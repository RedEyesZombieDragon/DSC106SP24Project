    1. So far, for this project, we have gotten the first visualization working
    and some of style choices for the website established. Because we are
    utilizing spotify metadata, we decided to go with a spotify themed color
    scheme. In our first visualization, we aim to just show the reader some
    trends of growth that are present in perceived "Industry Plants". This first
    visualization is interactive in that you can hover over the dots to get the
    exact number and you can change the artist that you see information for.

    2. In terms of what will be the most challenging parts to design for this
    project going forward, we see 2 parts. First off, the plan is to add at
    least one more visualization to cement the point that the term Industry
    Plant is not real. We plan on doing this by making a visualization that
    compares these growth trends to those of established artists. The second
    challenging part is creating a compelling narrative for a reader to explore
    as they go through our website. We plan on doing this by adding more visual
    elements. One idea we had about this is to add a quote or statistic from an
    outside reference from something about industry plants. Lastly, we also
    still need to remove the extraneous code that was given from the template.
